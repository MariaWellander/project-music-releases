# Music Releases

A pair programming project (by Joel Ã–hman & Maria Wellander) with the aim to create an responsive page with React components by rendering data from the Spotify API.

## The brief

In this project we are building a page which shows new album and single releases, using data from Spotify. The main focus was to learn how to use React components.
By reading through the project brief we decided on what problems to tackle first, which components to add and in which order, an adequate time structure and a constructive mindset.
During this project we used React, JSX, HTML, CSS & Git.
If we had more time, we would have wanted to add a full opacity effect on the play button.
